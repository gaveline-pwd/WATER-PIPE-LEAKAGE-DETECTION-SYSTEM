# WATER-PIPE-LEAKAGE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
## Introduction
The Water Pipe Leakage Detection System is an IoT-based solution designed to identify and alert users about water leakages in real-time. This system helps prevent water wastage, infrastructure damage, and costly repairs by detecting anomalies in water flow and pressure.

## Features
- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks water flow and pressure levels.
- Leak Detection Alerts: Sends instant notifications via SMS, email, or app notifications.
- IoT Integration: Uses sensors and microcontrollers (such as Arduino/Raspberry Pi) to detect leaks.
- Data Logging & Analytics: Stores historical data for analysis and predictive maintenance.

## Technologies Used
- Hardware: Flow sensors,ESP 8266 module, jumper wires and pipes.
- Software: C++
- Cloud Services:Blynk cloud computing platfrom

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Deployment:** Sensors are installed at critical points in the water pipeline.
2. **Data Collection:** The system continuously collects water flow and pressure data.
3. **Leak Detection Algorithm:** Uses predefined thresholds or AI-based anomaly detection to identify leaks.
4. **Alert Mechanism:** If a leak is detected, the system notifies users via mobile app, email, or SMS.
5. **User Action:** Users can inspect the reported location and take necessary corrective measures.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the water flow  to the microcontroller.
   - Ensure Wi-Fi is configured for connectivity.
2. **Software Setup:**
   - Upload the firmware to the microcontroller using Arduino IDE.
   - Deploy the backend system on a cloud/server.
   - Configure the mobile/web dashboard for monitoring.
3. **Testing:**
   - Simulate leakages by adjusting water pressure and flow rates.
   - Verify alert notifications and dashboard updates.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI-based Predictive Analysis:** Advanced ML models for detecting potential leaks before they occur.
- **Integration with Smart Home Systems:** Automate water shut-off in case of leakage.
- **Solar-Powered Sensors:** For enhanced sustainability and remote deployment.
